# NUMBERPLATE-DETECTION
This project demonstrates how to detect and extract text from vehicle license plates using computer vision techniques. It leverages OpenCV for image processing and Tesseract OCR to recognize the text on the detected number plates. This approach is useful for applications such as automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems.
